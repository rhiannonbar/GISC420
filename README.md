# GISC420
#### Rhiannon and Katie's Final Project

#### Purpose: 
1) To use ArcGIS Pro's Model Builder to create a workflow that helps select a site based on the viewshed from a linear feature (such as a road)
2) To create a Python script that replicates this workflow through the use of Jupyter notebooks and code

Locations trialed have been selected based on the importance of viewsheds in the siting and location of development. 

#### Potential Locations to Trial: 
Queenstown-Lakes, New Zealand
Wellington, New Zealand
Highlands, Scotland

#### Tasks
1) Find appropriate DEM
2) Create sample road lengths
3) Understand viewshed outputs
4) Think about workflow, combining raster
5) Trial in ArcGIS
6) Think about categorisation 
7) Experiment with different thresholds
8) Export code and look up pyarc 
9) Bring into Jupyter notebooks
10) Experiment and try and find pyarc solution

#### Potential Workflow
1) Inputs: DEM, linear feature, distance between points
2) Turn linear feature into points
3) Execute viewshed for each point
4) Combine resulting raster
5) Classify raster
