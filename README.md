# GISC420
#### Rhiannon and Katie's Final Project

#### Purpose: 
1) To use ArcGIS Pro's Model Builder to create a workflow that helps select a site based on the viewshed from a linear feature (such as a road)
2) To create a Python script that replicates this workflow through the use of Jupyter notebooks and code

Locations trialed have been selected based on the importance of viewsheds in the siting and location of development. 

#### Potential Locations to Trial: 
Queenstown-Lakes, New Zealand
Highlands, Scotland
